# LoAT

LoAT (**L**ower bounds **A**nalysis **T**ool) is a tool to automatically analyze lower bounds on the worst-case runtime complexity of integer programs (i.e. integer transition systems).

LoAT has been inspired by KoAT (<https://github.com/s-falke/kittel-koat/>) and uses a version of ranking functions and recurrence solving to proof lower bounds. The tool is
based on the recurrence solver [PURRS](http://www.cs.unipr.it/purrs/) and the SMT solver [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/).


## Paper

The technique behind LoAT is described in the following paper: coming soon.
